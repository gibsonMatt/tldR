- Make renderHTML work with non-rstudio installations. 
  There is something weird happening with different versions of pandoc than
  the one that ships with RStudio.
  This is probably an issue with my own pandoc, as I can't generate
  documentation either.
- Create standard doc template.
- Documentation headers for functions.
- Parse examples file(s).
- Interactive example editing.
