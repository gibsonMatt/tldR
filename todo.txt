TODO:

- Make renderHTML work with non-rstudio installations. 
  e.g., launch browser to render document.
- There is something weird happening with different versions of pandoc than
  the one that ships with RStudio.
  This is probably an issue with my own pandoc, as I can't generate
  documentation either.
- Create standard doc template.
- Documentation headers for functions.
- Parse examples file(s).
- Interactive example editing.
- Text menu to select function if e.g., redundantly named functions are loaded.
- Parse function name, including scoping of namespace.
  Recognize "package::function", "function" and resolve function using above if
  other than a single function is available.
- Search examples using tags, names, etc.
- Figure out why I can't fucking generate documentation!
- Generate documentation template function, like devtools::create()
- Contribute to docs repo from github API?
- Initialize docs repo automatically if needed; skip if not.
- Figure out tryCatch in tldr.
- Knit Rmd docs, don't just render as markdown.
