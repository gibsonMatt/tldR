# tldR
## Clear, helpful, community-supported R documentation for nontechnical users.

A sizeable portion of the R user base are academics in fields unrelated to
programming or computer science.
For these users, the R documentation is practically useless.
The tldR project aims to improve the accessibility of R as an environment for
data analysis to all users by implementing a community-driven documentation
framework with a focus on helping users get their analyses done without trying
to understand the minutae of e.g., S3 methods.

## Installation
`> install.packages("tldR")`
